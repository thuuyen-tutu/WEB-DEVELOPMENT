  <h1>Longs Peak: Diamond Route</h1>

  <p>
    One of the most awesome climbs in the park, yet still very accessible to the beginning climber,
    Kiener's Route is a Colorado Experience favorite. The route starts at Mills Glacier and proceeds up
    a 1000 foot couloir known as Lamb's Slide (ice axes and crampons required to climb Lamb's Slide.)
    Moving off Lamb's Slide, you are led across Broadway, a narrow ledge varying in width from several feet
    to six inches. The ledge overlooks a sheet of granite plunging down to Chasm Lake far below. Proceeding
    up from Broadway, you will climb to the summit of Longs Peak following a route requiring climbing gear
    and climbing technique. Kiener's is one of North America's classic climbs.
