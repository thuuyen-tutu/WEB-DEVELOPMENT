  <h1>Longs Peak: North Face</h1>

  <p>
    The North Face route of Longs Peak is the perfect tour for the beginner hiker/climber
    who wants to reach the summit following a different route from the main trail.
    The North Face is the most direct and shortest route and does not have the crowds
    you'd find in the more popular Keyhole route. The views from the North Face are spectacular
    and provide some of the finest scenery in the park.
